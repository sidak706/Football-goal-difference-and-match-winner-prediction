âš½ Football Match Outcome & Goal Difference Prediction
Predicting football match outcomes has long been a challenging and fascinating problem in sports analytics. In this project, we tackle two key tasks:

Goal Difference Prediction â€“ a regression task to estimate the score difference between two teams.

Match Outcome Prediction â€“ a classification task to determine whether the home team will lose.

We use a variety of features including team averages, playing styles, aggression, and home advantage to train machine learning models.

ðŸ§  Models Used
Goal Difference Prediction:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
Home Team Loss Prediction:
-Logistic Regression (with PCA)
-Support Vector Classifier (SVC) â€“ linear & RBF kernels
-Random Forest Classifier
-Dimensionality reduction via PCA was also explored to evaluate its impact on model performance.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings
Random Forest consistently outperforms other models for classification.

For regression, Linear Regression delivers competitive results despite its simplicity.

ðŸš€ How to Use
Clone this repository:

bash
```
git clone https://github.com/sidak706/Football-goal-difference-and-match-winner-prediction.git
cd Football-goal-difference-and-match-winner-prediction
```
Open and run Code.ipynb. It includes all preprocessing and modeling steps.

Note: Data preprocessing is time-consuming. To skip it, use the provided preprocessed dataset:

match_data.csv â€“ ready-to-use dataset for training and evaluation
